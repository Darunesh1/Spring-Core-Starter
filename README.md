## Getting Started

This project is aimed to provide a clear view of Spring Core and its concepts like AOP, bean injection, autowiring, and etc.

1. Constructor injection
2. Spring scope
3. Lifecycle of a bean
4. Setter injection
5. Bean injection
6. Collection injection
7. Autowire byName
8. Autowire byType
9. Bean annotation
10. AOP programs
11. Before advice
12. Throws advice

When running the project, you are required to follow the command instructions. Ensure that all the necessary concepts are loaded into the project. Be careful about what to run and what to leave commented out in the relevant sections of the bean.xml file.

When running the main function in the AOP module, refer to the AOP example file. I have used an IllegalArgumentException()


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- the folder to maintain dependencies: [To download all the required dependencies](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13-Y0jIW4T3D3B_PLspa_Ju-hNdt_IlG1?usp=sharing)



## Dependency Management

Download all the dependencies and add them to the classpath before running the project.
